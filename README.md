LLVM toolchain for Bazel [![Tests](https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-toolchain/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-toolchain/actions/workflows/tests.yml) [![Migration](https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-toolchain/actions/workflows/migration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-toolchain/actions/workflows/migration.yml)
=================

To use this toolchain, include this section in your WORKSPACE:
```python
# Change master to the git tag you want.
http_archive(
    name = "com_grail_bazel_toolchain",
    strip_prefix = "bazel-toolchain-master",
    urls = ["https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-toolchain/archive/master.tar.gz"],
)

load("@com_grail_bazel_toolchain//toolchain:deps.bzl", "bazel_toolchain_dependencies")

bazel_toolchain_dependencies()

load("@com_grail_bazel_toolchain//toolchain:rules.bzl", "llvm_toolchain")

llvm_toolchain(
    name = "llvm_toolchain",
    llvm_version = "8.0.0",
)

load("@llvm_toolchain//:toolchains.bzl", "llvm_register_toolchains")

llvm_register_toolchains()
```

The toolchain can automatically detect your OS and arch type, and use the right
pre-built binary distribution from llvm.org. The detection is currently
based on host OS and is not perfect, so some distributions, docker based
sandboxed builds, and remote execution builds will need toolchains configured
manually through the `distribution` attribute. We expect the detection logic to
grow through community contributions. We welcome PRs! :smile:

See in-code documentation in [rules.bzl](toolchain/rules.bzl) for available
attributes to `llvm_toolchain`.

For making changes to default settings for these toolchains, edit the
cc_toolchain_config template. See [tutorial](
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/site/docs/tutorial/cc-toolchain-config.md).

For overriding toolchains on the command line, please use the
`--extra_toolchains` flag in lieu of the deprecated `--crosstool_top` flag.
For example, `--extra_toolchains=@llvm_toolchain//:cc-toolchain-linux`. You
may need to also set the `--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution` flag.

If you would like to use the older method of selecting toolchains, you can
continue to do so with `--crosstool_top=@llvm_toolchain//:toolchain`.

Notes:

- The LLVM toolchain archive is downloaded and extracted as a separate
  repository with the suffix `_llvm`. Alternatively, you can also specify your
  own repositories for each host os-arch pair through the `toolchain_roots`
  attributes. Each of these repositories is typically configured through
  `local_repository` or `http_archive` (with `build_file` attribute as
  `@com_grail_bazel_toolchain//toolchain:BUILD.llvm_repo`).

- A sysroot can be specified through the `sysroot` attribute. This can be either
  a path on the user's system, or a bazel `filegroup` like label. One way to
  create a sysroot is to use `docker export` to get a single archive of the
  entire filesystem for the image you want. Another way is to use the build
  scripts provided by the
  [Chromium project](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/linux_sysroot.md).

- Sandboxing the toolchain introduces a significant overhead (100ms per
  action, as of mid 2018). To overcome this, one can use
  `--experimental_sandbox_base=/dev/shm`.  However, not all environments might
  have enough shared memory available to load all the files in memory. If this
  is a concern, you may set the attribute for using absolute paths, which will
  substitute templated paths to the toolchain as absolute paths. When running
  bazel actions, these paths will be available from inside the sandbox as part of
  the / read-only mount. Note that this will make your builds non-hermetic.

- The toolchain is known to also work with `rules_go`.

- The LLVM toolchain also provides several tools like `clang-format`. You can
  depend on these tools directly in the bin directory of the toolchain. For
  example, `@llvm_toolchain_llvm//:bin/clang-format` is a valid and visible
  target.
