# OS X relpath is not really working. This is a wrapper script around gcc
# to simulate relpath behavior.
#
# This wrapper uses install_name_tool to replace all paths in the binary
# (bazel-out/.../path/to/original/library.so) by the paths relative to
# the binary. It parses the command line to behave as rpath is supposed
# to work.
#
# See https://blogs.oracle.com/dipol/entry/dynamic_libraries_rpath_and_mac
# on how to set those paths for Mach-O binaries.
