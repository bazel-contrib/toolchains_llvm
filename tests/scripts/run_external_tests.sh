# We exclude the following targets:
# - cc_libs_test from rules_go because it assumes that stdlibc++ has been dynamically linked, but we
#   link it statically on linux.
# - external_includes_test from rules_go because it is a nested bazel test and so takes a long time
#   to run, and it is not particularly useful to us.
# - time_zone_format_test from abseil-cpp because it assumes TZ is set to America/Los_Angeles, but
#   we run the tests in UTC.
#   The rules_rust tests should be:
# @rules_rust//test/unit/{native_deps,linkstamps,interleaved_cc_info}:all
#   but under bzlmod the linkstamp tests fail due to the fact we are currently
#   overriding rules_rust locally as its not yet released in the BCR
